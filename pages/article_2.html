                <h2>Why did this topic come up?</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been guilty of being caught up
                    in my ego and it can be a challenge to manage as a designer.
                    I especially remember when I was a junior designer that I felt I
                    had to prove myself right as if my whole identity depended on it.
                    All that work I put in – the details, the sweat, the tears.
                    And then for people to critique it and say it's no good?
                    It felt horrible but that was because I was in the wrong mindset.
                    I cared more for my ego than I did for the people using my designs.
                    It was about me and not about them. Over time, I've come to realise
                    that is not the way to be.

                <p>
                    When putting forward an idea as a designer you should aim to prove yourself wrong, fast.
                    It's very easy to get caught up in your solution and your head. It's your idea and it's
                    important to you but you should avoid that big reveal. All that time spent in your head,
                    only to be shown your solution doesn't work or is simply not good enough.
                    Like an abstracted version of being caught with your pants down.
                </p>
                <p><i>With any idea you put forward as a designer you should aim to prove yourself wrong, fast.</i></p>
                <p>
                    Every day, designers are put in a position to come up with creative solutions
                    and serious things are going to be built based on that. Meetings are going to
                    happen, engineers are going to code, time and resources will both be spent,
                    with the hope that it will directly or indirectly generate money when it's
                    released. It can feel like a lot is riding on that and, sometimes, there is.
                    Couple all of that with your ego, too, and it can quickly feel that you should
                    be producing this beautiful, mesmerising design that solves not just all the
                    problems of the business – but the world! Your team and your customers will
                    all gasp with delight. But of course, that's completely unrealistic and you're
                    most likely living in a fantasy land. But maybe you're a genius and you knock
                    the gate with your first version. It does happen but there is a higher chance
                    that there will be things you simply didn't know, didn't consider or simply didn't
                    think about. All those things you were just so sure were right were actually very,
                    very wrong indeed.

                    So when designing something, you should think more like a scientist.
                    A scientist puts forward a hypothesis and then they go through a series
                    of experiments adjustments and conversations to test it. There are no real
                    truths when it comes to science, only ideas and theories that are less wrong
                    than others. If an idea is proven to be wrong then they can move past it fast
                    and, in turn, move one step closer to "right". Of course, in design, there is
                    no such thing as being right. But there are certain steps towards being better.
                    And when it's better, the people using your product or service will thank you
                    for it.
                </P>

                <h2>Do yourself a favour</h2>
                <p>
                    By going in with the mindset to prove yourself wrong first,
                    you are opening yourself up to the right kind of feedback that would get
                    you one step closer to better. If you lock yourself up with the mindset of
                    only proving yourself right, you will grab on to any piece of feedback that
                    aligns only with your predetermined assumptions. You may as well put your
                    fingers in your ears.

                <h2>How to apply this in your work?</h2>
                <p>
                    Develop your designs quickly using sketches, wireframes or
                    prototypes and share early and often. Share with your team and,
                    even better, with the people you are designing for. Resist the
                    temptation to dive straight in with a high fidelity design, that
                    takes hours to make. Avoid giving your ego the time to think it's
                    right and that this design is "the one". Listen carefully, accept
                    critique, and be willing to be proven wrong by default. This will
                    result in faster iterations towards a better design. Don't short
                    change yourself, and the people you design for, by not allowing the
                    right kind of feedback to come in from the start
                </p>
