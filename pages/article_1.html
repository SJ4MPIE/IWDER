                <h1>A UX designer walks into a Tesla Bar</h1>
                <p>
                    I borrowed a friend’s Tesla 3 yesterday. About 5 minutes into the ride,
                    the windshield started fogging up. I couldn’t find the defroster on the
                    large control screen Teslas are so famous for. In desperation, I tapped
                    the CAR icon but that took me to the settings screen which ended up
                    being a dead end. Frustrated, I opened the side windows to clear the windshield.
                    While pushing every button on the steering wheel, I accidentally discovered
                    the voice control and was finally able to get the defroster working. It was such
                    an odd experience I tweeted about how frustrating it was:
                </p>

                    <img class="img_avg" src="../img/tweet.png" alt="tweet">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Little did I know that Tesla had updated to a new <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> just a few
                    days earlier.
                    It’s been more than a bit controversial: A <abbr title="User experience"> UX </abbr> designer had
                    just walked into
                    a Tesla bar with a hornets nest on the floor.The rather severe name calling
                    and ad homimum attacks I got in response to this tweet are unfortunate but
                    it is really just a day in the life of Twitter. However, I was surprised by
                    the sheer arrogance and Dunning-Kruger on display. These people know literally
                    nothing about human perception or performance. Someone was wrong on the
                    internet! I have no illusions this post will convince the TeslaBros of
                    anything but this is an interesting UX design example for those that want
                    to explore. It’s worth going through the problem in a bit more detail.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The problem isn’t really that complicated:
                    originally the defroster icon was visible on the bottom.
                    With the latest December 2021 update it is now hidden behind
                    the temperature indicator. Tapping the temperature brings up a
                    sub-window with the defroster icon. So, yes it’s just 2 taps vs 1,
                    but that can’t be that bad right?

                <h2>Point 1: 1+1=3</h2>
                <p>Edward Tufte has this visual rule that 1+1=3. With a single line on the screen, you have just that
                    single object, but adding a second line does something interesting, it adds a third ‘object’ on the
                    screen, the negative space between the two. All good visual designers deeply understand this effect.
                    In UX design we have a cognitive equivalent. If you have two buttons, there is a third ‘object’
                    created, the decision a user must make on which button to tap. This cognitive load is invisible and
                    rarely discussed but it can be a real source of confusion.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Point 2: Icon Standards + Hard Buttons</h2>
                <p>
                    1+1=3 is one reason why there are international standards
                    for most automotive icons. Common and well understood icons
                    reduce cognitive load and help users learn new devices more easily.
                    Here is the “Defrost” icon standard. Even Tesla uses it!
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img class="img_smaller" src="../img/defrost.png" alt="defrost icon">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    This is one reason why hard-buttons are so effective in old-school cars.
                    They all use these same standard icons so it’s easier for new users to scan
                    across them and find the one you want without any training.
                </p>

                <h2>Point 3: Tesla v10 was similar to old-school car designs</h2>
                <p>
                    The v10 version of the software had the standard defrost icon along a bottom row.
                    I’d like to discuss the pros/cons of digital vs physical buttons at a later time
                    but my high-level point right now is that the previous v10 version actually met
                    my needs. I would have scanned and found the button easily. I’m not anti-Telsa,
                    I’m anti-v11.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Point 4: Icon, icon, who has the icon?</h2>
                <p>
                    But in moving to v11, this icon bar was changed. The defroster icon is now gone.
                    No amount of “scanning for a known icon” will work. Instead of a light task anyone can
                    do in the moment, it’s replaced with a task that needs training: <b>I have to KNOW where
                        it’s hiding. I actually must <abbr title="Read The Fucking Manual"> RTFM </abbr>.</b> I’ll
                    admit, this isn’t the world’s hardest thing to learn.
                    But when I’m moving at 70mph on a busy highway with the screen fogging up, being a little
                    bit harder isn’t great. This is why automotive <abbr title="User experience"> UX </abbr> is so hard.
                    It’s the context and the severe
                    consequences that make it far more impactful than a poorly designed phone app.
                    Most importantly, in 99% of cars on the road today, I don’t need to <abbr
                        title="Read The Fucking Manual"> RTFM </abbr> to
                    turn steer, accelerate, brake, use the turn signals, or turn on the damn defroster.
                    That’s why these things are standardized. There are lots of things I will likely need
                    the manual for but not these basics. The v11 design broke this.

                <h2>Point 5: Flat design for the lose</h2>
                <p>
                    This new redesign uses a common flat design approach:
                    using simple text labels as buttons. When I was scanning for the defrost icon,
                    I saw the temperature readout but assumed it couldn’t be a button. In a calmer
                    situation, I likely would have explored and tapped on it, but instead, in a
                    slight panic, I tapped on the CAR icon which took me down a dead end.
                    Making the temperature actually look more like a button is one way to
                    improve this. It would still be 2 taps and I’d still argue more dangerous,
                    but at least there would be a stronger visual signal to help guide me towards
                    the solution.
                </p>

                <h2>What to do?</h2>
                <p>
                    Automotive design is hard. The “move fast and break things” of Tesla is
                    perfectly fine for Swipe-Right phone apps but in a car with lives at stake,
                    they can’t be so cavalier. It certainly looks pretty to remove half of your
                    buttons but this comes at a cost. Visual design isn’t the only variable to
                    optimize. My suggestion would be to rank the core functions you want to be
                    quickly found and put those in the bottom bar. If that doesn’t work, I’d work
                    on a “more” option that guides my eye to these additional hidden buttons.
                    Finally if you MUST put it under the temperature label, lose the flat design
                    aesthetic and make it feel more like a tapable button.
                    I want to make it crystal clear that these are my <b>initial</b> thoughts
                    and like any proper <abbr title="User experience"> UX </abbr> design, they require prototyping and
                    testing
                    to refine them further. The final solution is likely some variation.
                    I’m not suggesting a perfect solution now, but a user-centered goal that
                    I’m trying to achieve. Then comes the hard work of testing and retesting
                    to make sure you’ve got it right. You can’t cut corners.
